## 859. Buddy Strings (Easy)

Given two strings s and goal, return true if you can swap two letters in s so the result is equal to goal, otherwise, return false.

Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices i and j (0-indexed) such that i != j and swapping the characters at s[i] and s[j].

For example, swapping at indices 0 and 2 in "abcd" results in "cbad".

Example 1:

Input: s = "ab", goal = "ba"
Output: true
Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b' to get "ba", which is equal to goal.

```class Solution:
    def buddyStrings(self, s: str, goal: str) -> bool:
        if s==goal:
            s1=set(s)
            return len(s1)<len(goal)
        elif len(s)!=len(goal):
            return False
        k=[]
        s1=list(s)
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i]!=goal[i]:
                k.append(i)
        if len(k)==2 and k[0]<k[1]:
            s1[k[0]],s1[k[1]]=s1[k[1]],s1[k[0]]
        return ''.join(s1)==goal```
